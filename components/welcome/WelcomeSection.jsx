            All the fabrics used for our coats and jackets are made in cashmere,
            merino wool, silk or block printed cotton. In addition to these, we
            have introduced a range of colourful and easy to wear Italian
            knitwear. We have been a member of the Charity Fair Association
            since 1998 and have had stalls at many charity fairs, shows and
            luncheons around the country. Through these fairs we have donated
            ten per cent of our turnover to many charities.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We are an excellent choice for special occasions, offering
            handpicked collections of exquisite silk jackets, coats, dresses,
            kimonos, and silk dressing gowns.
